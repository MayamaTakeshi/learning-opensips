List of opensips modules that will be excluded of build:

- db_oracle (need to install lib)
- osp (Requires special building procedure (check module documentation) : libosp-dev was installed but we got 'osp/osp.h: No such file or directory')
- cachedb_cassandra (need to install lib)
- cachedb_couchbase (need to install lib)
- cachedb_dynamodb (need to install lib)
- sngtc (need to install lib). Not usable anyway as this required sangoma transcoding card (hardware)
- aaa_radius
   From module documentation:
     One of the following libraries must be installed before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     - radiusclient-ng 0.5.0 or higher See http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/. (not installable using apt)
     - freeradius-client See http://freeradius.org/.
     By default, radiusclient-ng is used. To change at compile time to freeradius, uncomment the FREERADIUS=1 line in main Makefile.
- event_sqs (need to install aws lib)
- http2d (need several libs)
- launch_darkly (???)
- rtp.io (alpha, needs librtpproxy)
- tls_wolfssl (could not be compiled. Issue with autogen)
